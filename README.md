Rainfall Prediction Machine Learning Pipeline
Overview

- This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict daily rainfall using historical weather data from Arizona. The focus is on data preparation, feature engineering, model experimentation, and evaluation, with attention to model limitations and deployment considerations.

Technologies

- Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Key Work

- Cleaned and aggregated 25+ years of raw weather data, engineering domain-driven features such as temporal signals, pressure changes, and lag variables

- Prototyped and benchmarked multiple regression models, including baseline and forward-feature-selected models, using cross-validation and metrics (R², RMSE, MAE)

- Analyzed overfitting, feature redundancy, and bias, and documented model limitations and scalability considerations for real-world deployment

Why This Project Matters

- This project demonstrates the full machine-learning lifecycle, from messy real-world data to evaluated models and responsible deployment thinking. It emphasizes experiment design, interpretability, and production awareness, skills critical for building reliable ML systems beyond offline experimentation.

Disclaimer

- Academic project completed as part of a Foundations of Machine Learning course.
